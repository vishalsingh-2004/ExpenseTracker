## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following installed:

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 20 or later
* Maven
* Node.js (18+) & npm/yarn
* A running instance of **MySQL** or **PostgreSQL**

### 1. Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd expensetracker/expensetracker
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment:**
    Open `src/main/resources/application.properties` and update the database connection details, JWT secret, and email service credentials.

    ```properties
    # Example MySQL Configuration
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/moneymanager
    spring.datasource.username=${YOUR_DB_USERNAME}
    spring.datasource.password=${YOUR_DB_PASSWORD}
    
    # ... other security and email configurations
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```
    The Spring Boot API will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

### 2. Frontend Setup (React/Vite)

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ../expensetrackerwebapp
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
